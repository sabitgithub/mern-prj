Learning the MERN Stack

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, and it is a popular stack for building web applications. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with MERN:

Install Node.js: Node.js is required to run JavaScript on the server. You can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). Choose the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for stability.

Set up a MongoDB database: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that works well with Node.js. You can create a free account on MongoDB Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to set up a hosted MongoDB database. Make sure to note down the connection string.

Create a new project: Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project. Navigate to the project directory.

Initialize a new Node.js project:



1. Check Node [ node -v]
2. install react app [npx create-react-app mern-prj]
3. Create folder backend and go there
4. command npm init -y
5. npm install express cors mongoose dotenv
6. npm install -g nodemon
7. create server.js file and add connections and others.
    note: make sure database network access is concrete or for all ip access.
